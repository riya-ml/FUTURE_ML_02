# Support Ticket Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to automatically classify customer support tickets into predefined categories such as billing, technical issue, account issue, etc.

## Problem Statement
Customer support teams receive a large number of tickets daily. Manually categorizing these tickets is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to automate ticket classification using NLP and Machine Learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Model
Logistic Regression is used for classification. TF-IDF vectorization is applied to convert text data into numerical features.

## How It Works
1. Load dataset  
2. Clean text  
3. Apply TF-IDF  
4. Split train-test  
5. Train Logistic Regression  
6. Evaluate model  

## Evaluation Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.20

## Future Improvements
- Improve preprocessing  
- Try advanced models  
- Handle class imbalance  

- Deploy the model
